My blog app is capable of making CRUD api calls for create, update, delete, fetch post by id, and fetch all posts.
On an individual updating post page, edit mode is triggered by clicking anywhere on the post.
Once editing is complete, the "save post" button must be pressed to save changes. The note can be deleted by clicking on the "delete" button.
A new note can be created anytime.

My blog app now handles user authentication. A user must sign up to create an account, sign in to access an established account, and sign out to sign in with a different user. A new post cannot be created unless a user is signed in. The post author's name appears on each individual post page.
