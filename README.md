My app is capable of making CRUD api calls for create, update, delete, fetch post by id, and fetch all posts.
On an individual updating post page, edit mode is triggered by clicking anywhere on the post.
Once editing is complete. The "save post" button must be pressed to save changes. The note can be deleted by clicking on the trash icon.
